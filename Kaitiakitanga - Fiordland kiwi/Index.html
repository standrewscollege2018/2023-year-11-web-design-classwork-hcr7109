                    The "Kaitiakitanga" (guardianship) of the "Fiordland Kiwi" is vital for its natural habitat. When we let people know about this, it becomes more concerning for humans to react, therefore, humans will become more aware of the safety of our Fiordland Kiwi. The kiwi is one of Aotearoa’s national icons. It is known as te manu huna a Tāne – the hidden bird of Tāne. Kiwi have always been under the protection of Tāne Mahuta, god of the forest. Today, they are keenly protected by diverse groups of people who act as kaitiaki (guardians) of the kiwi. One group – the Lake Waikaremoana Hapū Restoration Trust – has helped create a conservation methodology that many others now follow.
